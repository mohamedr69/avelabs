// In fact, arvfb is a Virtual Function Bus simulator, it is in charge of

// So arcom only need to display the signals on the VFB, it is not in charge
// of signals' transition, but for debug purpose of AUTOSAR module,
// Somehow, arcom will both display signals and in charge of signals' transition.
